	<p class="blurbParagraph">A note from the narrator:<p/><p class="blurbParagraph">You've seen me before, as you see me now when you stare in the mirror, and gaze at your loved ones, and walk out in public. You've heard me whisper faint echoes through your mind, and creep dolorous feelings through your chest, and writhe nervous tremors through your guts. You know me, yes, as intimately as these people knew me, this father, mother, and two sons, now broiling in the flames of a betrayal as fierce and fervent as the very passions that have led them here. It's quite a tale, theirs, concerning love and loss, fear and forgiveness, failure and perseverance, but weaved within their tumultuous yarn is a far more incisive experience that I want to give you, somewhat akin to the one I gave them, in fact. Come, you don't actually think you can ignore me like I'm just some character in a book, do you? Ha! I bet you fancy yourself capable of escaping the essence of your own blood and marrow, too, huh? In control, as they say? Ha! Ha! Brilliant! That's just how I want you to start! Go on then, put your dukes up, fill your lungs, puff your chest out, grit your teeth, and let's begin with the end.</p>

I love this spot. The way the fog creeps through the tree line and waltzes across
the lake makes me think of this idea of peace I’m always hearing about. Ha. And you know, the way the ripples betray the otherwise perfect reproduction of the night sky is a lot like what’s just happened to . . . wait –– we . . . no, I . . . yes . . . I apologize, this is all very new . . . we’ll learn all about ripples in due time. Right. I remember . . . Peace! Of course! Take Shauna here, for example, lying in the dampened leaves of a dying season, her face paling in the moon’s dead sunlight. There is no discernible breeze, and she is not yet accosted by flies, mosquitoes, or any other number of nocturnal despots, (good day), glorified by a Deathly Stealth in the shadows, (good night). Still, she lies, eternal . . . peaceful. We didn’t . . . no . . . I didn’t kill her, of course; not directly, at least. The explanation is a bit of an exploration, but suffice it to say that this whole thing, literally, figuratively, and otherwise, started, and ended, only a moment ago. That may clear up in time. 

<p class="format">In respect to Shauna, it all started back there in the log cabin currently fueling an inferno like an exclamation point in a truly interminable story. Some people will scream in horror at the monstrosities perpetuated there, but you won’t; I promise.</p>

<p class="format">In regard to those atrocities, well, Here Lies Shauna, which some might concede is bad enough, but over there, in that billowing blaze blistering in the darkness, lie the bodies of two boys, the sons of Shauna, Jacob and Noah, thirteen and fifteen, returning to ashes after barely having recovered. She didn’t do it . . . directly, at least, either. She loved those boys. She loved her family. But just here on the other side of us, that silhouette at the edge of the water sobbing and screaming at the sky like a
crazy person –– he did do it, quite directly, as evidenced by the bloodied clothes glimpsed in the flickering light of the flames. He loved her, too. Truly, he did. Tragically, some might even say, and the kids . . . the kids . . .</p> 

<p class="format">The Peace here is more accurately defined as a period of individual squabbles before a collective squabble inevitably took hold. From unity to revolution, in historical terms. From Pan to Homo, on honest terms. For human he is, indeed! Yes? And, look, he is sorry, after all, falling to his knees, bellowing his voice across the expanse of water like the rumbling thunder of a storm before being lost altogether in the crepuscule. He cries his children’s names, his wife’s, and in desperation he even cries to an ideology he’s never once subscribed to, leaning on a positively biased agnosticism, as close to spiritual as he’s ever been; but when the silence of the night refuses to betray itself, he blurts out mechanical apologies to the indifferent fog, the isolated moon, the impenetrable shadows. Up there, the blueish orb is devastating. In his darkness, it’s crushing. He longs for Dawn’s rosy fingered rays to bathe his face and set the clouds ablaze with a splash of red embers on a background of purples and pinks, lifting away the darkness and intruding the permanently rotting nothing within him that no pill can tame, no creed can conquer, no hope can help.</p>

<p class="format">If any idol can be upheld, to Helios, he holds: the true creator, the father of time, the nurturing progenitor of The Fundamental Radiation. So often its force has lifted him from dark corners and slathered him with . . . hope . . . ? Something like it, at least . . . for a while. He can see it now with his eyes closed. He can feel its warmth like a cosmic blanket
wrapping its offspring, penetrating the burnt out crust of a bankrupted mind and
breathing life into it, breathing direction, and . . . “Argh!” It’s vanished when his eyesAnthems Of The Blood And The Marrow - Tombstone Kane snap open and he collapses in spasms to the ground. There in the sand, on hands and knees, the silhouette sobs, drools, and convulses with hardened denials of the so-raw- it’s-still-mooing type of reality that tends to really stick with a guy; you know, for . . . ∞. Poof. Now, despite these disturbances in the otherwise delightful evening –– namely: he and his disappearing dreams of estellation, the fire’s fervent force, and the candescent spirit once known as Shauna now whitening, now hardening into a petrified effigy –– the sweet scent of decomposing leaves and pine needles percolates through the crisp night air, eliciting a sense of serenity in direct contrast with the vicious violence initiated by some of the other atoms in the general area. From deep in the woods echoes an owl’s call following a coyote’s howl. From above, aerial squeaks deceive those invisible in the unlight. (good evening). Phoebe’s beautifully pocked face beams like a beacon in the night, and in her azure light the figure, the man, rises from the sands and stands staring at the inky pillar of smoke billowing up from the flames, up, and up, toward the ∞ beyond.</p> 

<p class="format">Soiled with blood, sweat, tears, sand, he stares, mouth agape, unable to produce a sound or manage a step. How? he thinks. How could I have done such a thing? How did it happen? He knows the answers, naturally, but can he believe them?</p>

<p class="format">Such is the crux of the paradox. This paradox, I mean, and so will you . . . in time . . . His face, an ugly physical representation of the rampant emotions running amok in the subliminal, shifts from the direction of the cabin, to our own, hello there, though occluded we remain from the intense concentration bequeathed upon Shauna. A sharp gasp escapes him like an interjection in the insane narrative currently mauling his mind.</p>

<p class="format">“Oh, God!” he whimpers, and, his face polluted with runnels of tears, limbs trembling, lips quivering, he stumbles precariously toward the exarch xylem of this, his, new reality.</p>

<p class="format">At her feet he stands as if staring at a dream, a fallacy, a phantasmic manifestation from which a simple pinch would suffice to break to pieces and permit a rearrangement of the shattered edges of time back into a cohesive, idealized, Peaceful form; but from this dream she’s the awakened one, and he, the still sleeping. The paling skin of her face and hands, flung about according to gravity’s sole discretion, glows in gloomy shapes that fortify his hope in a fabricated reverie in spite of being so fluently humiliated by the
languid lurch of the pool polluting the ground a shade darker than Phoebe’s face can alight. To his knees again, moaning, again, numb hands grasping first at the air, and then at the hair, the face, the shoulders; “No! No!” he says, his wrecked eyes darting about her halcyon features, her posture sprawled before him like a broken marionette. He lowers his head to her chest, listening for what he knows he won’t find there, but trying anyway. “Oh! No! Oh, God! My poor girl! My poor, beautiful, girl. I love you so much. I love you so, so much. I’m so sorry. Oh! Shit!” Fists cored with fabric, he pulls at her shirt writhing, crying, pleading with the lifeless thing of Her for an ideal closely esteemed with Peace: Forgiveness. Ha. Gasping, he gently, (now), slips a senseless arm behind her head and cradles the mass against him, rocking it with a benign attention that would have been slightly more useful once, (then). A quaking hand clears
the wisps of hair matted against her forehead and caresses the side of her face, staring beyond him with defunct eyes. Whimpering, the wounds further saturating him with the coagulating essence of one once loved, he hugs her, kisses her, tries to wake her, fails.</p>

<p class="format">The uproarious chorale of the cabin suddenly dominates his senses, and as he replaces the expired weight on the ground, for a moment in that volatile chorus, he hears the roiling laughter of children. He almost calls out, almost allows himself to fall headlong into the delusion, but the abrasive light accosting his eyes sends a shock of raw tangibility tearing through him like a lightning bolt. It’s too real. It’s too . . . real.</p>

<p class="format">Hand clasped over his mouth, he stares at the rollicking flames and suffers an immense urge to implode under the pressure of his own awareness. The kids . . . the kids . . . The ferocious dance of combusting combustibles continues careless of the confounded countenance countering the certainty of its creation. Like a weary wraith he clambers to his feet, extending a final lovelorn glance at she who will never again be, and staggers
forth on stiff legs, as if lured, toward the pugnacious pyre. With arms extended, face raised, he welcomes it and its, (and his), beastly brutality. The roaring intensifies as something drastic crashes from an upper part to a lower one, sending skyward a swell of scintillating sparks in a shambled defiance of gravity. Gnashing his teeth, gasping for air, he stands still in the stupefying sear with sardonic orbs staring, searching, supplicating for the stamina necessary to reach the substantial solution no longer seeded in psychosis, but in sagacity. Another gasp escapes him as he moans: “Noah . . . Jacob . . . I’m . . . oh . . . God! I’m so . . . I’m . . . I don’t know what . . . I don’t . . .”</p>

<p class="format">Like a ball to the belly he crumples to the ground and is pinned there by an unquenchable void so ruthless and adamant that there is no mistaking its recognition: Death. “Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!” he bellows as the most natural reaction to finding his foot already far past the edge. Fire and brimstone now; Peace, soon. “Ha! Ha! It’s so . . . it’s all so . . . ridiculous! This whole thing . . . this entire . . . life . . . it’s . . .” Shaking his
head, he smears a muddy palm across his sweat soaked face and coughs, and cries,
and rolls onto his back, laughing, weeping . . . empty. The peppered lights of the sky, obscured by the heavy column of smoke, escape the scrutiny of a man otherwise occupied with facing his ultimate, unequivocal, inevitability. This is his it. IT, it. No more beyond nor consequent before. Peace, in perfected form. Yes! In proper definition. The universal practice of placing a cosmic period after so many misplaced commas, misused semicolons, and an overabundance of question marks strewn across paragraphs connected by jagged transitions, unnecessary interjections, and mistaken conjunctions never to be corrected, annotated, or otherwise revised, as per the universe’s elegant insistence on Original Script.</p>

<p class="format">Soon startled, however, worming about without warning, he sits up and stares into the dirty darkness beyond the blaze as if eyeing an apparition whose presence was heretofore left unconscious. He swallows a slab of anxiety over a parched Adam’s apple and points an accusing finger at us, at me,
and says: “You! You did this! You made me do this!” But a smile is all I, We, can proffer, neither leaning in assent nor dissent of the ambiguous context he’s biased within the paradox. Thus with feverish eyes he stares at the mystery, he stares at me, at We, and in that diabolical light we all stand together, connected by advents spanning reams of realms which neither you, nor he, have taken heed. But fear not, for before us lies a thing profound and yet devoid of definition in spite of the relative, intimate, contexts hereby tendered.</p>
